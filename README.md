# Imgraph

Imgraph is a tool I created to rapidly create illustrations within the node and span design guidelines. A photograph is used as the base, and a graph consisting of nodes and spans is constructed over the photo, highlighting connections within the photo.

The software was rapidly developed leveraging ChatGPT: I had a working prototype within 2 hours, and an additional 3 hours fine-tuning features and presentation.

## Features

- Create, move, and delete nodes with intuitive mouse interactions.
- Resize nodes with keyboard controls.
- Connect nodes to show relationships.
- Toggle between light and dark themes.
- Save your creation as an image.
- Upload images as a background for your nodes.

## Controls

- **Create New Node**: Left-click on an empty area.
- **Delete Node**: Right-click on a node.
- **Drag Node**: Left-click and drag a node.
- **Toggle Node Color**: Double-click on a node.
- **Resize Node**: Click on a node and use keyboard commands (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- **Create Connection**: Ctrl + left-click on one node, then on another.
- **Switch Line Color**: Use the "Switch" button.
- **Save Image**: Use the "Save" button.
- **Upload Image**: Use the image upload feature.
